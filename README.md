Initial Commit

This project aims to be a virtual "Haeyes like" compatible modem.
The capability/configurability is made with a .json configuration file
that describes the AT commands that are supported.

It's main goal is to enable (very, very) old (outdated and without docs/sources)
that run on DOS, Win9X ,  that are dependent on a modem attachment 
and/or (old ISA PC/XT, [X234]86...ish  and/or CP/M MP/M)  that do not have Ethernet support to 
have PPP enabled via serial port (either virtualized on QEmu/VBox/VMs/XEN/simh/Z80 ... you name it ) using 
standard pppd (or Windows ... arrrggghhhhh)   dial-in  servers.

Did it 'cause was dragged into a situation like that, and did not find any other solution lying around.

This is a work in progress (WIP), and an amalgamation (copy, stealing and adapting)  of lot of other projects here on github and other places.

Will do the credits along the way..
Contributions/suggestions/complains/rants are welcome.
